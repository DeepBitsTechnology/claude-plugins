# Deepbits Cyber Assistant Plugin for Claude Code

The Plugin equips Claude Code with advanced binary analysis capabilities for tasks such as incident response, malware investigation, and vulnerability assessment. It connects to both cloud-based analysis platforms and local tools via MCP, enabling seamless hybrid workflows. With features including local Windows system scanning, browser hijacking detection, registry and network monitoring, suspicious file analysis, and remote binary analysis through tools like Ghidra, Qilin, and angr, the plugin transforms Claude Code into a powerful AI-assisted workspace for comprehensive system and binary security analysis.

## Overview

The Claude Code Security Analysis Plugin extends Claude Code with advanced cybersecurity and binary-analysis capabilities, enabling developers and analysts to perform in-depth system investigations directly within their coding environment.

This plugin seamlessly integrates with both cloud-based analysis platforms and local security tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating a unified workspace for intelligent, AI-assisted security analysis.

Designed for incident response, malware forensics, and vulnerability research, the plugin empowers users to:

- üß© Investigate compromised systems to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and attack traces.

- ü¶† Analyze malware samples to uncover behaviors, persistence methods, and payloads.

- üõ°Ô∏è Perform vulnerability and exploit analysis, including binary diffing, patch validation, and code comparison.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Combine cloud automation with local expertise, integrating Deepbits‚Äô agentic binary-analysis capabilities into Claude Code.

Specialized Cybersecurity Capabilities

This plugin provides Claude Code with specialized cybersecurity features, including:

- üíª Local Windows system scanning for malware, configuration weaknesses, and security issues.

- üåê Browser hijacking detection to identify malicious extensions or modified settings.

- üßÆ Windows Registry analysis to reveal persistence mechanisms or misconfigurations.

- üßæ Suspicious file detection through behavioral and signature-based analysis.

- üîó Network connection monitoring for unusual or unauthorized communications.

- üß† Remote binary file analysis powered by Ghidra, Qilin, angr, and other advanced analysis frameworks.

Together, these capabilities transform Claude Code into a comprehensive cybersecurity co-pilot‚Äîbridging the gap between code intelligence, system defense, and binary analysis.

### Skills Format

The `binary-analysis` skill follows the proper Claude Code skill format with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: binary-analysis
description: Analyze suspicious binary files using remote Ghidra tools...
---
```

This allows Claude to automatically recognize when to activate binary analysis capabilities.

## Available Commands

### `/scan-system`
Perform a comprehensive security scan of the local system including:
- Browser hijacking checks
- Registry analysis
- Process monitoring
- Startup program review
- File system scanning
- Network connection analysis

### `/scan-registry`
Deep scan of Windows Registry for:
- Malware persistence mechanisms
- Autostart locations
- Browser setting hijacks
- Policy restrictions
- Shell extensions

### `/analyze-binary <file-path>`
Upload and analyze a suspicious binary file:
1. Obtains access token from MCP server
2. Uploads file to remote sandbox
3. Performs Ghidra static analysis
4. Generates comprehensive threat report

### `/check-browser-hijack`
Detect browser hijacking across all installed browsers:
- Homepage and search engine modifications
- Malicious extension detection
- Shortcut target verification
- Proxy setting analysis
- Hosts file checks

### `/scan-suspicious-files`
Scan file system for suspicious files in:
- Temp directories
- AppData folders
- Common malware locations
- Recently modified executables
- Unsigned binaries

### `/check-network`
Monitor network activity for suspicious behavior:
- Active TCP connections
- Listening ports

## Using the Cyber Security Analyst Agent

The plugin includes a specialized agent for security analysis tasks:

```bash
# Launch the agent for comprehensive analysis
/agent cyber-security-analyst

# Or let Claude Code automatically invoke it for security tasks
"Analyze my system for malware"
```

The agent will:
1. Assess the security situation
2. Perform targeted scans
3. Collect and correlate evidence
4. Generate structured reports
5. Provide remediation guidance

## Binary Analysis Workflow

When you need to analyze a suspicious file:

1. **Use the command:**
   ```bash
   /analyze-binary C:\path\to\suspicious.exe
   ```

2. **The plugin will:**
   - Get access token via `workspace_get_access_token` MCP tool
   - Upload file using curl to https://mcp.deepbits.com/workspace/upload
   - File is saved to `/sandbox/[filename]` on remote server
   - Perform Ghidra analysis (decompilation, string extraction, etc.)
   - Generate comprehensive threat report

3. **Analysis includes:**
   - File metadata and hashes
   - PE structure analysis
   - Imported/exported functions
   - String artifacts
   - Behavioral indicators
   - Malware classification
   - Remediation recommendations

## MCP Server Integration

The plugin connects to the Deepbits MCP server for remote analysis:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drbinary": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.deepbits.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools
- `workspace_get_access_token` - Obtain authorization token
- Ghidra analysis tools (via remote sandbox)
- Binary decompilation services
- Malware analysis capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Safe Analysis
- All binary analysis occurs in remote sandbox environment
- No suspicious files are executed locally
- Analysis uses static analysis techniques only
- Files are automatically isolated

### Privacy
- Local scans only access data on your system
- Binary uploads are securely transmitted via HTTPS
- Access tokens are temporary and session-based

### Permissions Required
- **Local**: Read access to file system, registry (via PowerShell)
- **Remote**: Upload capability to MCP server for binary analysis

## Example Usage

### Quick System Check
```
User: "Check my system for malware"
Claude: [Runs comprehensive scan, checks registry, processes, network]
```

### Browser Hijack Investigation
```
User: "My Chrome homepage keeps changing"
Claude: [Runs browser hijack scan, identifies modifications, provides fix]
```

### Suspicious File Analysis
```
User: "I found a weird file called update.exe in my temp folder"
Claude: [Uploads to sandbox, runs Ghidra analysis, provides threat assessment]
```

### Registry Investigation
```
User: "Scan my registry for malware persistence"
Claude: [Deep registry scan, identifies suspicious entries, recommends removal]
```

## Reporting Format

All scans generate structured reports with:

1. **Executive Summary** - Brief overview of findings
2. **Detailed Findings** - Each issue with evidence and severity
3. **Risk Assessment** - Threat levels and confidence ratings
4. **Remediation Steps** - Clear, actionable instructions
5. **Prevention Recommendations** - Future security measures
